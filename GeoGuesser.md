Final:
We saw a landmark which is St. Basils Church and the Kremlin.  
Visted a website (kind of like street view) which gives precise coordinates. On matching the street view so it matches the image , we found that the location is Red Square, Russia.

Slightly changing and some trial and error , gives the flag.
