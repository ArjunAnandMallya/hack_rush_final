Methods:

Since we are not that famliar with assembly, we tried to put all the code in ChatGPT to see if it could do anything. This led us to converting it to C , so that its easier to understand it. The word le chiffrage ind√©chiffrable refers to the vigenere cipher.
Final Method
The assembly file was converted to C, then to python using ChatGPT.
A decryption code was made by gpt from the python code, and the cipher was found, which led us to finding the flag.
