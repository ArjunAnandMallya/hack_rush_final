Methods:
We tried various python scipts, but they did not work. Moreover, we thought that it was related to some hexadecimal. But the term "glaringly obvious" in the question led us to beleive that the solution is simple.

Final Method:
the zip file was run through a python script which checks for HRCTF.  
The flag was found after converting to text in the file "bfzaks".
